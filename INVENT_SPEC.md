Assess the effective use of surrounding space relative to the cat. Examine the relationship between the subject and the environment that frames it, asking whether the space around the cat plays a supporting role or competes with it. In strong compositions, the surrounding area gives the cat room to breathe — providing context like a sunlit floor, a rumpled blanket, or a stretch of open sky — without overwhelming the subject or stealing focus. The background should recede while the cat advances; there should be a clear visual hierarchy with the cat at its apex. Identify problems such as backgrounds so busy and cluttered that the eye has nowhere to rest, frames so wide that the cat is dwarfed into insignificance, or crops so tight that the cat feels trapped against the borders of the image. The goal is to judge whether the proportion of the frame allocated to the subject versus everything else feels natural and inevitable — whether the cat has been given exactly the space it needs, no more and no less. Score high when the surrounding space supports the cat without competing, creating a sense that the frame could not have been drawn any other way. Score low when the environment overwhelms, suffocates, or marginalizes the subject.

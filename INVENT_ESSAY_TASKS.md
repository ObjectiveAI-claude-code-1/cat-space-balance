1. Evaluate visual hierarchy by determining whether the cat is the undisputed focal point of the photograph. Look at the surrounding space and ask whether it recedes behind the cat or competes with it for the viewer's attention. The background should be quiet while the cat is loud — the compositional logic of the frame should guide the eye to the cat first and return it there naturally. Identify problems such as busy backgrounds with colorful or patterned elements that pull the eye sideways, or competing objects that fracture attention so that the cat becomes one element among many rather than the reason the photograph exists. Score high when every part of the frame knows its place and the space understands it is there to support, not to perform.

2. Evaluate spatial proportion by judging whether the amount of the frame the cat occupies relative to everything else feels natural and inevitable. There is no single correct ratio — a cat can be small in a vast landscape and still feel perfectly placed, just as a tight crop can succeed if the cat does not feel pressed against the edges. What matters is whether the proportion feels deliberate and considered, as though the photographer understood intuitively how much world the cat needed around it. Identify problems at both extremes: frames so wide that the cat shrinks into insignificance and becomes an incidental detail, or crops so tight that the cat feels trapped and confined against the borders of the image. Score high when the cat has been given exactly the space it needs, no more and no less.

3. Evaluate environmental harmony by assessing whether the content of the surrounding space complements the cat's presence or undermines it. A harmonious environment provides context and mood — the coziness of a blanket, the openness of a garden, the calm geometry of a windowsill — without demanding close study or stealing focus. The setting should feel like a place the cat belongs, telling a quiet story that begins and ends with the subject. Identify problems such as visual noise from cluttered objects, competing patterns, or colors that have no relationship to the cat, reducing the subject from protagonist to bystander in its own photograph. Score high when the environment and the cat are in conversation with one another, and the surrounding space supports the subject in quiet, purposeful partnership.
